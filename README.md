# Credit-Risk-Analysis
The purpose of the challenge exercise is to analyse a credit risk based on the the dataset provided by appliying machine learning model. 
* The stages of the machine learning process  went through as part of this analysis are as follows:
Classify the variable to features and predictive values i.e Separate the data into labels and features, i.e the loan status. 
Determine the value counts to see how reprsetative the classes are .
Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data
Interpret the accuracy , precision and recall of the models being used
